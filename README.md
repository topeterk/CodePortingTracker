# CodePortingTracker

You are a software developer and you are facing one of those problems, then this tool may help you:  
* You want to recreate source code using a different language
* Source code is poorly readable and you are going to rewrite the code
* You are moving from one software framework to another
* Your source code needs to use a different API and must be modified


## How can this tool help me?
1. :new: Create a single XML file for your project you want to update/port anywhere on your computer.  
2. :open_file_folder: Add all files which has to be recreated and must be tracked by this tool.  
3. :repeat: as long as lines of codes are not marked as __done__..
  * :page_facing_up: Open the file(s) you want to start/continue porting.  
  * :pencil2: (Suggestion) Mark all lines of code you are going to rewrite/port/update.. as __in progress__.  
  * :heavy_check_mark: When the new software supports a specific portion of the original source code, simply mark it as __done__.  
5. :white_check_mark: The whole functionality was completely ported. Enjoy the safety that not a single line of code was missed.
